# Multi-Model Email Classification

## Description
Developed an interactive email classification application that enables users to choose from multiple trained machine learning models such as AdaBoost, Voting, SGD, Histogram Gradient Boosting, and Random Trees Embedding to automatically categorize emails. The system incorporates data preprocessing steps and uses a command pattern architecture to streamline execution. This solution significantly reduces the time spent on manual email organization by providing accurate model driven classifications based on user selected algorithms.

## Setup
